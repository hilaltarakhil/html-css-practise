    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
    implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more
    than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
    displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
    graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is
    probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
    technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more
    detail in other parts of the Learning Area. Javascript is used by
    programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content
    like applications and browsers.

        JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in
        the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all
        websites. JavaScript is a fun and flexible programming language. It’s
        one of the core technologies of web development and can be used on both
        the front-end and the back-end.

        Here we learn JavaScript, starting from scratch and go on to advanced
        concepts like OOP. We concentrate on the language itself here, with the
        minimum of environment-specific notes.
