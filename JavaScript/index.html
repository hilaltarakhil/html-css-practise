    bbnhj often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the
    core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over
    97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12]
    often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
    conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
    multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
    programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
    working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
    the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not include
    any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
    APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers,
    but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
    The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and
    JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
    the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. What are
    JavaScript used for? Javascript is used by programmers across the world to
    create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers.
    JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the
    world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.
    JavaScript is a fun and flexible programming language. Itâ€™s one of the core
    technologies of web development and can be used on both the front-end and
    the back-end.`
